* interrupt support
** we need to be able to handle interrupts
** should be able to wire lisp functions as interrupts callbacks
** keyboard interrupt?
* REPL
** maybe we want computer-side "shim" that we can inferior-lisp from Emacs
*** use readline
* Better error handling/reporting
* jump/break/nonlocal return?
** do we want exceptions?
* do we want lexical scope?
** need to maintain a scope chain, pass environments around with functions
** maybe 
* Clojure-style macros
